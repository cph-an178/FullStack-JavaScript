## Detailed Learning Goals:

### Express middleware
_**Middleware**_ functions are functions that have access to the request object `(req)`, the response object `(res)`, and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named `next`.
```javascript
var app = express();

app.use('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request Type:', req.method)
  next()
})
```
